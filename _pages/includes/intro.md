I work at [Shanghai AI Lab, OpenDialogLab Team](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a researcher now in Shanghai, doing some fundamental interactive-system-related research. I am now  on dialog system, semantic parsing and large language model research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [chenzhi@pjlab.org.cn](mailto:chenzhi@pjlab.org.cn).I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学) with a Ph.D's degree, advised by [Kai Yu (俞凯)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=76) and [Lu Chen (陈露)](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (西北工业大学) with a bachelor's degree. I also collaborate with [Bei Chen (陈蓓)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/beichen/) and [Jian-Guang Lou (楼建光)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jlou/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

My research interest includes dialog system, reinforcement learning and large langauge model. I have published more than 15 papers at the top international NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI and the top international NLP journals such as TACL and TSALP.
