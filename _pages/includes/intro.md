I work at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a researcher now in Shanghai, doing some fundamental pretrained-language-model-related research. I am now on large language model, long-context reasoning and agent-driven data synthesis research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [chenzhi@pjlab.org.cn](mailto:chenzhi@pjlab.org.cn). I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学) with a Ph.D's degree, advised by [Kai Yu (俞凯)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=76) and [Lu Chen (陈露)](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/). 

My research interest includes large language model, long-context reasoning and reinforcement learning. I have published more than 20 papers at the top international NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI, ICML and the top international NLP journals such as TACL and TSALP.
