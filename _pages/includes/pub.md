[OPAL: Ontology-Aware Pretrained Language Model for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00534/114595/OPAL-Ontology-Aware-Pretrained-Language-Model-for) \\

- OPAL is the first pretrained language model for end-to-end task-oriented dialogue (TOD). Unlike chit-chat dialogue models, task-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules: dialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state consists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user's constraints to search the domain-related databases. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method and downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple recovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG, respectively.

[AdapterShare: Task Correlation Modeling with Adapter Differentiation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.728.pdf) \\
**Zhi Chen**, Bei Chen, Lu Chen, Kai Yu and Jian-Guang Lou

- Current MTL methods pay more attention to task selection or model design to fuse as much knowledge as possible, while the intrinsic task correlation is often neglected. It is important to learn sharing strategies among multiple tasks rather than sharing everything. AdapterShare leverages an adapter differentiation method to explicitly model task correlation among multiple tasks. AdapterShare is automatically learned based on the gradients on tiny held-out validation data.

[LGESQL: Line Graph Enhanced Text-to-SQL Model with Mixed Local and Non-Local Relations](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.198.pdf) \\
Ruisheng Cao, Lu Chen, **Zhi Chen**, Yanbin Zhao, Su Zhu and Kai Yu

- Line Graph Enhanced Text-toSQL (LGESQL) model mines the underlying relational features without constructing metapaths. By virtue of the line graph, messages propagate more efficiently through not only connections between nodes, but also the topology of directed edges. Furthermore, both local and non-local relations are integrated distinctively during the graph iteration.

[Decoupled Dialogue Modeling and Semantic Parsing for Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.270.pdf) \\
**Zhi Chen**, Lu Chen, Li Hanqi, Ruisheng Cao, Da Ma, Mengyue Wu and Kai Yu

- Decoupled multi-turn Text-to-SQL framework has two models, where an utterance rewrite model first explicitly solves completion of dialogue context, and then a single-turn Text-to-SQL parser follows. A dual learning approach is also proposed for the utterance rewrite model to address the data sparsity problem. Compared with end-to-end approaches, the proposed decoupled method can achieve excellent performance without any annotated in-domain data.
